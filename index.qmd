I'm an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://economics-sp.fgv.br" target="_blank">Sao Paulo School of Economics</a> from Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV)

Before joining FGV, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the <a href="https://ifs.org.uk" target="_blank">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>, a graduate student at Yale University, and a student at University of Sao Paulo. 

I'm interested in Labor Economics, Economics of Education, and Public Finance, particularly in developing countries.
