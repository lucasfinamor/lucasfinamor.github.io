I'm a Post-doctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://ifs.org.uk" target="_blank">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> for the 2023-2024 academic year.

In August of 2024, I will join the <a href="https://economics-sp.fgv.br" target="_blank">São Paulo School of Economics</a> from Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) as an Assistant Professor.

I'm interested in Labor Economics, Economics of Education, and Public Finance, particularly in developing countries.
